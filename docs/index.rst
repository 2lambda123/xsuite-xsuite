Xsuite
======

Xsuite is a collection python packages for the simulation of the beam dynamics in particle accelerators. It supports different computing platforms, in particular conventional CPUs and and Graphic Processing Units (GPUs).

Xsuite is composed by the following packages:
 - **Xobjects**: infrastructure to manage the memory, compile and execute code on different computing platforms.
 - **Xtrack**: single-particle tracking library
 - **Xfields**: computation of the electromagnetic fields generated by particle ensambles using Particle In Cell (PIC) solvers or simplified distributions.

The implemented physics models are being documented in `this guide <https://github.com/xsuite/xfields/blob/master/docs/physics_manual/physics_man.pdf>`_ (for now only Xfields).

The source code is available in these `GitHub repositories <https://github.com/xsuite/>`_.
