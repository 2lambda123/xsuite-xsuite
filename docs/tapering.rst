Compensate radiation energy loss
================================

Xsuite provides a tool to compensate the energy loss due to the synchrotron
radiation, by configuring the phase od the RF cavities to compensate for the energy
loss and adapting the strength of the magnets to the local momentum of the
particle on the closed orbit.
