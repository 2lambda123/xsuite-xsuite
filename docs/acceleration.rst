Acceleration
============

The acceleration can be simulated by adding to the line the element
:class:`xtrack.ReferenceEnergyIncrease` as illustrated by the following example.

.. literalinclude:: generated_code_snippets/acceleration.py
   :language: python

.. figure:: figures/acceleration.png
    :width: 75%
    :align: center

    Particles motion in the longitudinal phase space as obtained from
    the simulation above. `See the full code generating the image.
