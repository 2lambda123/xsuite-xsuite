Synchrotron radiation
=====================

The following example illustrates the use of the synchrotron radiation in Xsuite.
Explanations can be found in the comments interleaved in the code. For the
considered case, the lattice is loaded from a MAD-X thick sequence and transformed
in thin using the ``MAKETHIN`` command of MAD-X to obtain a thin sequence compatible
with Xsuite.
